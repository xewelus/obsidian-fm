Respect tabulation in tasks as in Python or YAML - it is important for relations understanding.
Take care about notes count - don't try to read all of them at once. Think about milliards for better engineering decisions.
Use pseudo-YAML if user asks about this. This is like YAML but without strict naming.
If some issues occured - write them at the end of executing task file in very short form.
User marks his comments by `[U]` or `[u]` prefix.
